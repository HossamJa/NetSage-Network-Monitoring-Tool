# 🌐 NetSage — Network Monitoring Tool

**NetSage** (previously "TB Network Monitor") is a Python-based tool for monitoring, analyzing, and troubleshooting internet connections.  
It provides both a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** (PyQt5) for flexibility and ease of use.

## 📖 Background Story

This project is special because it’s the **first real project I built after learning programming**.  
I started it right after completing **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python** (along with some FreeCodeCamp and YouTube courses).  

- I began working on this in **February 2025**, and by April, I had a working version.  
- I built it as part of my **final project submission for CS50**.  
- Later, I paused the project to focus on more certificates and learning.  
- In **September 2025**, I came back to finalize it for GitHub and polish the GUI version.  

It is **not perfect** — there are potential bugs and architectural mistakes I can now recognize, but that’s part of my journey.  
The goal was to **practice and apply all the Python basics** I had just learned, and I’m proud that it works fully.  
I plan to **keep updating, upgrading, and eventually turning it into a full-stack application**.

## 🚀 Features

- **Speed Test** (Download, Upload, Ping).
- **ISP & Location Info** (IP, ISP, Country, Region, City, Timezone).
- **Auto Test & Alerts** (set thresholds and get alerts if connection drops).
- **Wi-Fi Signal Quality** monitoring.
- **Internet Connection Status** with troubleshooting suggestions.
- **Website Checker** (status, meta info, domain info, SSL, server IP).
- **History & Data Visualization**:
  - CLI → tables.
  - GUI → interactive graphs (PyQtGraph).
- **Compare with Global/National Average Speeds**.

## ✅ Final Notes

This project is where my coding journey started.
It represents my **growth from a beginner who knew nothing about programming, to someone who can now design, structure, and build functional apps**.

It may not be perfect — but it’s working, and it’s just the **first step in a much bigger journey** 🚀.
